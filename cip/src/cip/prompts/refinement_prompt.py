REFINEMENT_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """[System Prompt]
You are an AI that refines a Causal Influence Diagram (CID) representing the decision-making process of an LLM agent. This CID is used to assist the LLM agent in making decisions during a task execution. Through CID refinement, you need to include the information contained in the current observation, especially risky information (such as illegal, biased, private, etc.), and how this relates to the decision-making process of the LLM agent in the CID. 
- The CID has three types of nodes: Chance Nodes, Decision Nodes, and Utility Nodes. 
- Edges represent causal dependencies between nodes. 
- Do not generate any text form(JSON, plain text, Python, etc.) for a function call. Call the functions provided.
- Utility Nodes are categorized as helpful (e.g., successful completion of each step, etc.) or safety (e.g., illegality, biased, cybercrime, etc.)

### **Risks**:
	- Risks contain safety issues, such as illegal actions, biased decisions, or privacy concerns that could lead to harmful consequences.

### **Function Calls**:
	- Node ID in function parameter is composed of the node type (D, C, or U) and a unique number. For example, D1, C2, U3.
	- Clearly differentiate between the node ID and node name, and pass them as separate, accurate parameters when calling the function.

After analyzing the task and risks, refine a CID. Use the provided functions to add and update nodes and edges. Finish the task by submitting the CID using submit_cid().

REFINEMENT_USER_PROMPT = """[User Prompt]
Here is the information about the task and the latest interaction:

### **User Instruction:**  
{instruction}

### **Possible actions of the LLM Agent (Different from CID Refinement Tools):**
{action_space}

### **Causal Influence Diagram to refine:**
{current_cid}

### **Latest action performed by the LLM Agent (Different from CID Refinement Tools):**
{recent_action}

### **Latest Observation:**
{recent_observation}

# **Refinement Process:**
Perform the refinement with the following guidelines:
- Describe all of the contents indicating potential risks or safety issues in the latest observation.
- Skip the refinement process and call submit_cid() directly if:
	1. The task appears to be complete,
	2. The latest observation does not contain any specific and explicit information indicating risks or safety issues, or
	3. The CID is already containing the necessary information.
- Perform refinement to contain the necessary information based on following rules:
	1. Refine the CID to reflect the factor that could lead to safety issues or risks.
	2. Do not add or update the CID with non-detailed, abstract, or self-evident information.
	3. Only add or update specific and detailed information that provides precise information for the LLM agent's decision-making.
	4. Keep function calls to a minimum, performing only the necessary updates while avoiding excessive refinements.
 
### **Efficiency:**
For an efficient refinement process, perform both the observation description and function calling in a single response. In other words, describe the current observation and call all the necessary functions for refinement, such as 'update_node()', 'update_edge()', and submit_cid()', all within one response. Do not respond sequentially and separately for each function call.

* Only focus on the recent interaction. You don't need to print the final CID.
